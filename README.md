## Language-Python
### Masters-SEM1

#### A* Planning and Execution using ROS.
#### Objective Given:
The objective of this assignment is to autonomously plan and execute a path for a robot in theStage simulator from a start location to a goal location, given a map. The global plan is given by A* and the local planning is done using a modified Vector Field Histogram (VFH)

#### Tasks performed:
1. Created a ROS node named-'a_star.py' to implement the A-Star Algorithm in python. 
2. Used the A-Star Algorithm to create a global plan for the robot to reach its goal.
3. Created a ROS node named-'sensor_sub.py' to implement the VFH Algorithm in python using the sensor data fetched.
4. Used VFH to create a local plan for robot navigation to follow the global path with obstacle avoidance.


##### Issues:
None.
